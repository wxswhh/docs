# Test plan
## Team Intruduction
You may call us Xinji Rongwei, base on Chengdu of China.We have already deployed six IDCs which distritued of national, 
it was located in Chengdu, Xian, Wuhan, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, 
with different Operator of National backbone network. Configuring 3PB+ storage pool for each IDC, 
high performance CPU of Intel,378GB RAM,and 10 Gigabit networking.
We will also add new high performance servers to achieve the optimal configurations and maximum efficiency of the cluster.

A team of 12 numbers people including R & D, hardware and software operation and maintenance personnel serves for Filecoin Project,
So, we have adequate resources to participate in the PB-scale miner test, 
And We are willing to provide real valuable test data.
## Power validation(testnet2,todo) 
## Test list
- Benchmarking
  - CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD and HDDs, also including Switches
  - Differnet hardware configurations(it has been determined that 4 CPUs will be tested, Combined test of different CPU and different capacity of RAM,
  SSD/HDDs and networking will be included too.)
- Networking bandwidth and throughput metrics
  - Metrics of Gigabit and 10 Gigabit networking 
- Filecoin software configurations
  - Sector builder and sizes under test
  - Sector loss monitoring
  - Daemon - Miner configurations
  - Sealing and Proofs metrics
  - Deal state metrics
  - Blockchain metrics
  - mined block metrics(ePoSt time)
  - Seal Worker configurations(different configuration do different job, maximum efficiency)
